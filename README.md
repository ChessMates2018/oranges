# Oranges to Oranges

This App is currently being developed as of September 2018. 

## Technology
Oranges to Oranges focuses on using socket.io to make an interactive game experience. We hosted our static frontend using Firebase, while hosting an external server on Digital Ocean. You can visit the repo linked towards the bottom to see our React Native integration (still in progress).

### Team

This was a two week project with 4 members with 1 team lead. Merge requests were approved by the team lead. Daily standups and "team walkthroughs" helped keep the team communicating and on task. The team pair programmed on a daily basis to avoid bugs, educate each other on socket.io, and push each other to communicate our logic effectively.
